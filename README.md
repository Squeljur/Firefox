# about Squeljur/Firefox
My customizations to Firefox browser, including only user.js ~~and a userChrome.css.~~ 

~~The userChrome.css is basically [Soft-Bred/Brave-Fox](https://github.com/Soft-Bred/Brave-Fox/) with a few settings disabled.~~

~~# Installing userChrome.css~~
~~To install, place every file from the [userChome folder](https://github.com/Squeljur/Firefox/tree/main/userChrome), into the `chrome` folder in the profile's 'root directory'.~~

~~On **Windows** is `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXX\chrome`. (You can also get there via the about:profiles)~~

~~Then finally, restart Firefox.~~

# Installing user.js
To install, place the `user.js` into the profile's 'root directory'.

Because I am lazy, I will refer to L8, [Installing userChrome.css](#installing-userchromecss)

Then finally, restart Firefox.
