# GIVE UP GITHUB
I've decided to migrate all of my repo's (including private) to CodeBerg. This repo can be found at https://codeberg.org/Squeljur/Firefox. **NO FURTHER UPDATES WILL BE ADDED HERE**.


Note: we encourage you to add the below to your existing `README.md` on your GitHub project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

# about Squeljur/Firefox
My customizations to Firefox browser, including only user.js ~~and a userChrome.css.~~ 

~~The userChrome.css is basically [Soft-Bred/Brave-Fox](https://github.com/Soft-Bred/Brave-Fox/) with a few settings disabled.~~

~~# Installing userChrome.css~~
~~To install, place every file from the [userChome folder](https://github.com/Squeljur/Firefox/tree/main/userChrome), into the `chrome` folder in the profile's 'root directory'.~~

~~On **Windows** is `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXX\chrome`. (You can also get there via the about:profiles)~~

~~Then finally, restart Firefox.~~

# Installing user.js
To install, place the `user.js` into the profile's 'root directory'.

Because I am lazy, I will refer to L8, [Installing userChrome.css](#installing-userchromecss)

Then finally, restart Firefox.
